# Learning `C` with Topman
This repository holds some of the codes that were written in some live learning sessions with [Topman Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike), where we learned certain concepts about `C` programming in a manner that helped us appreciate the **ALX Software Engineering** program and the tough projects with short deadlines.

Also contained in the repository are some assignments done in a bid to practice what was taught in the live sessions, in order to gain mastery and really learn by doing.
